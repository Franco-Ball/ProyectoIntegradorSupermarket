# Supermarket

This is a Django Supermarket application 

## Domain case

In this case, a supermarket chain is requesting a system for managing cashiers and their shifts, branches, checkouts, articles and their stock.

## Objective

The supermarket's objective is to provide its services, sell products and earn the highest profits possible

### Our solution

Our solution proposes to make a Django server that displays an html page, which through a user registry allows cashiers to enter a page where they can register sales and print tickets. It also offers a page with the best-selling products and offers of the moment, available to all customers.

### Installing

Clone the project to a folder 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Franco-Ball/ProyectoIntegradorSupermarket.git
```
and through the use of a virtual environment, type the following command:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
thus installing all the necessary libraries to run the project.

## Using the system

To run the server you must use the command 

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```
therefore you must enter the following address ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```. 
Having already entered the indicated address, cashiers can log in and enter the section to start registering sales.
